# Horiseon

## Project Description:

For the company Horiseon, I fixed the bugs on the website. I've edited some of the wrong elements used in the wrong place. I made it more understandable by commenting on the codes that have no explanation. However, I learned what it takes for a website to work, as well as how to work more regularly and clearly. I will try to use these experiences in future projects.
